# Information Security (ISA-561)

Lab Setup Intructions
-	This lab has been tested on a pre-configured Ubuntu 20.04 VM. When you download and unzip the file you will get a .vdi file representing the pre-configured Ubuntu image. 
-	Install the free VirtualBox software to be able to run the Ubuntu image on your computer. The VM image has been tested on Version 6.1.16. You can check the following VM Manual to stand on the detailed steps to import the VM to VirtualBox.
-	Start the VM and login into the account with the username seed, the password is dees. Once you are logged in to the VM, download the lab setup files from the following link: Lab Setup files.


## Project 1 - Secret Key Encryption

### Objective:
The learning objective of this lab is for students to get familiar with the concepts in the secret-key (Symmetric-Key) encryption. After finishing the lab, you should be able to gain a first-hand experience on encryption algorithms, encryption modes, paddings, and initial vector (IV). Moreover, you will be able to use tools and write programs to encrypt/decrypt messages.

### Tasks:
* Task 1: Frequency Analysis
* Task 2: Encryption using Different Ciphers and Modes
* Task 3: Encryption Mode – ECB vs. CBC
* Task 4: Padding
* Task 5: Error Propagation – Corrupted Cipher Text


## Project 2 - RSA Public Key Encryption & Signature

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to gain hands-on experience on the RSA algorithm.

### Tasks:
* Task 1: Deriving the Private Key
* Task 2: Encrypting a message
* Task 3: Decrypting a message
* Task 4: Signing a message
* Task 5: Verifying a signature


## Project 3 - Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) Lab

### Objective: 
The objective of this project is to gain hands-on experience on PKI, how its used to protect the Web and how Man-in-the-middle attacks can be defeated by PKI.

### Tasks:
* Task 1: Becoming a Certificate Authority(CA)
* Task 2: Generating a Certificate Request for your Web Server
* Task 3: Generating a Certificate for your Server
* Task 4: Deploying Certificate in an Apache based HTTPS Website
* Task 5: Launching a Man-In-The-Middle attack

## Project 4 - Transport Layer Security (TLS) Lab

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to help you understand how the TLS works and how to use TLS in programming.

### Tasks:
* Task 1a: TLS Handshake
* Task 1b: CA's Certificate
* Task 1c: Experiment with the hostname check
* Task 1d: Sending and getting data
* Task 2a: Implement a TLS Server
* Task 2b: Testing the server program using browsers
* Task 2c: Certificate with multiple names
